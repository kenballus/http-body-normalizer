- No Whitespace between fieldname and colon (e.g. Content-Type :) - MUST not be allowed based on RFC9112
- No Content-Type Should not be used. If used the server tries to guess based on body or treat it like octet-stream (RFC2046 section 4.5.1 - RFC9110 section 8.3)


Field Syntax (RFC 9112 Section 5):
```  field-line   = field-name ":" OWS field-value OWS ```
Field Line Parsing( RFC9110 Section 5-5):

Multiple (duplicate) Field Names (RFC9110 section  5.2 and 5.3):
The get concatinated together.
The proxy should not change the order
unless multiple definitions are allowed, sender MUST NOT do this

field-value (rfc9110 section 5.5):
- must be ascii
- CR,LF,NUL are invalid!
- singleton fields -> only support one value
- list-based fields -> allow multiple field values

Parameters (rfc9110  5.6.6)
- parameter name is case insensitive!
- whitespace is not allowed around "="


Content-Type (rfc9110 8.3):
- is a singleton field BUT
- it is sometimes incorrectly generated multiple times, resulting in a combined field value that appears to be a list. Recipients often attempt to handle this error by using the last syntactically valid member of the list, leading to potential interoperability and security issues if different implementations have different error handling behaviors.

Media-Type (rfc9110 8.3):
- type/subtype
- both case insensitive!
- charset is case insensitive
- all these are allowed:
```
  text/html;charset=utf-8
  Text/HTML;Charset="utf-8"
  text/html; charset="utf-8"
  text/html;charset=UTF-8

```
Multipart Media-Type (RFC2046#section5-1)
- 

- No header field is required in the body part
- header names only that begin with "Content-" have meaning
- all other header fields MAY be ignored
- Although they SHOULD generally be retained

- In Content-Transfer-Encoding field [RFC 2045], no encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is


Boundary:
- value between 1 to 70 chars (no space)
- in the header after content type. if boundary value has ":" or ";" or any weird character you should wrap it in double quotes
- Boundary delimiters must not appear within the encapsulated material, and must be no longer than 70 characters, not counting the two leading hyphens.
-- e.g. --gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p
